        <p>Akcxis Immigrations is committed to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of our clients. Consequently, we take necessary measures to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. We may use client information for various purposes, including conducting business, providing services, communication, legal compliance, and service improvement.
</p>
        <p>Refunds are not provided for early service termination. Refund percentages apply to the full service fee paid, provided the entire fee is paid without any balance outstanding. Clients agree to pre-registration for immigration opportunities, understanding that eligibility may be confirmed later. </p>
        <p>We are not liable for delays caused by third-party services or refunding fees paid to external authorities. Clients are responsible for additional fees and charges related to immigration applications. Chargebacks are not permitted except as outlined in the agreement. We reserve the right to terminate services under certain conditions.
</p>
        <p>
Clients must provide necessary documentation within the stipulated timeframes. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of service fees. We operate under Indian laws and have no control over processing times or outcomes of immigration petitions.
