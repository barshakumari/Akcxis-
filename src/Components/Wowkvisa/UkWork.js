                  <p><b>Apply Online: </b> Complete the online visa application form on the UK Government’s official website. This will include filling out your details and your CoS, if applicable, and answering questions about your employment.</p>
                  <p><b>Pay the Visa Fee and Healthcare Surcharge: </b>  Pay the required fee for your visa application and the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), and you will be granted access to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.</p>
                  <p><b> Book and Attend a Biometric Appointment:</b> You’ll need to have your fingerprints and photograph taken at a Visa Application Centre as part of your application.</p>

                  <p><b>Attend an Interview (if required): </b> In some cases, you might be asked to attend an interview.</p>
                  <p><b>Receive Your Visa Decision: </b> Wait for the decision on your visa application. Processing times can vary, so check the typical times for your visa type.</p>
