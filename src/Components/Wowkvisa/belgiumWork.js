                                <p className='fw-bold'>Step 1: Find a Job in Belgium</p>
                                <p>As the first step in the process, you naturally need to have a job. You can look for work online in Belgian job portals. EURES, the European Job Mobility Portal, is a great place to start. After securing a job, your employer must provide you with a work contract in Belgium before you can apply for the work permit.</p>

                                <p className='fw-bold'>Step 2: Apply for the Work Permit</p>
                                <p>After you have been employed, you have the right to apply for a work permit. You can apply personally at the Belgium embassy or consulate in your home country, or your employer can apply for you in their local residence authority.</p>

                                <p className='fw-bold'>Step 3: Apply for a Work Visa</p>
                                <p>The work permit allows you to live and work in Belgium, but you will need a D visa to enter. You need to apply for a long-stay visa before you move to Belgium, while your employer applies for your work permit to the immigration office in Belgium.</p>

                                <p className='fw-bold'>Step 4: Travel to Belgium</p>
                                <p>Once you get the job and your long-stay visa, you can travel to Belgium and visit the local town hall to receive your work and residence permit. Then, after living in Belgium for four to five years, you will have the right to reside in Belgium permanently.</p>
